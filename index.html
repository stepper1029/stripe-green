        Not sure what the climate crisis is? Looking for ways to get involved? 
        Want to learn more about environmental justice? You're in the right place!
        We created Stripe Green to help young people like us get involved
        in the environmental movement. Climate change is a pressing issue in the world right now. 
        Itâ€™s not something that will just go away on its own, or an issue that can wait to be addressed.
        Without immediate action, the planet and the human race, especially marginalized groups, are at serious risk.   
        The most dominant contributors to the climate crisis are large corporations.
        There are many steps you can take to support the environment.
        By supporting some of the politicians we have listed, you can make sure to stand by the candidates with the future of the planet in mind.
        Additionally, you can follow the steps on our Take Action checklist to implement sustainable actions 
        in your everyday life! And be sure to check out our secion on Additonal Education, to keep yourself and others informed on environmental issues.

        The environment and everything it contains is in great danger.
        For young people, our futures are at stake! This crisis will
        impact marginalized communities hardest and first. For this reason,
        we must act fast because people in power are not treating this
        situation with the urgency that they should be! If you want to 
        join the people all over the world in this movement, you can start by supporting the organizations listed
        <a class="link" href="support.html">here</a>. You can also click <a class="link" href="sustainability.html">here</a>
        to find ways to become more sustainable in your personal life.
