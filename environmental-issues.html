 <!-- climate change question 1--> 
      <h4 class="question">
        What is climate change?
      </h4>
      <p class="answer">
        Climate change is a change in the usual weather patterns of a certain area. 
        When people use the term “climate change”, they are usually referring to the 
        change in Earth’s climate due to carbon emissions. The Earth’s climate is always 
        changing and it goes through cold and hot periods that can last millions of years. 
        However, humans are accelerating the process significantly, to the point where 
        it’s harming the environment. 
      </p>
    
<!-- climate change question 2-->
      <h4 class="question">
        What does climate change look like?
      </h4>
    <div class="issues-img">
      <p class="answer">
        Climate change can look like many things, from an extra inch of rain to a 
        hotter-than-usual summer day. Generally, it looks like dramatic and irregular 
        weather patterns. Global warming is also a big part of climate change. In the 
        last 100 years, the Earth’s average temperature has risen one degree Fahrenheit. 
        It may not seem like much, but it’s enough to significantly damage ecosystems 
        and the wildlife that live in them. Click <a class="link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/">here</a>

<!-- deforestation question 1-->
      <h4 class ="question">
        What is deforestation?
      </h4>
    <div class="issues-img">
      <p class="answer">
        Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees either for timber that can be 
        used as fuel or to make room for agriculture, manufacturing, or construction. 
        Beef, soy, palm oil, and wood products are responsible for most of the tropical 
        deforestation. About 3.9 million square miles of forest have been lost since 
        the beginning of the 20th century. In just the past 25 years, forests shrank by 
        502,000 square miles, and it’s estimated that a chunk of forest the size of a 
        soccer field is lost every second.

<!-- deforestation question 2-->
      <h4 class="question">
        Why do we need forests?
      </h4>
      <p class="answer">
        Forests are home to 80% of terrestrial biodiversity and in places like the tropical 
        forests of New Guinea are home to 6% of the world’s species of plants and animals. 
        Forested watersheds are responsible for 75% of the Earth’s freshwater. Over half the 
        global population relies on these watersheds for drinking water and agriculture. On 
        top of everything, forests capture carbon dioxide and emit oxygen. Tropical trees 
        alone provide about 23% of the climate mitigation that’s needed to offset climate 
        change. Not only does deforestation stop the mitigation of greenhouse grasses, but it 
        also accounts for nearly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Forests are vital to the 
        survival of the planet and deforestation is contributing to the ruin of our environment.

        What is pollution and where does it come from?
      </h4>
    <div class="issues-img">

      <p class="answer">
        Pollution just refers to any substance that negatively impacts the environment. 
        Pollution causes an imbalance in the ecosystem and contributes to global warming. 
        Air, water, and soil pollution are the three main types of pollution that harm the 
        environment. Greenhouse gasses, chemical runoff, and non-biodegradable products 
        have a large negative impact on the environment.

        What is the greenhouse effect?
      </h4>
      <p class="answer">
        Only 30% of the sun's radiation is reflected by clouds and ice while the other 
        70% is absorbed by oceans, land, and atmosphere. As the earth absorbs radiation 
        and heats up, it releases heat in the form of thermal radiation that gets passed 
        out into space. This is known as the greenhouse effect because the process of 
        absorbing and releasing gas is similar to that f a greenhouse. Gases in the atmosphere
        that absorb radiation are referred to as "greenhouse gases" because they are the 
        greatest contributor to the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is on of the
        leading causes of global warming. The burning of fossil fuels and agricultural practices
        are the greatest producers of greenhouse gasses. To reduce your carbon emissions, try a
        plant-based diet or public transportation! Check out our advice on

        The most important thing is to listen to BIPOC environmental activists and hear what
        they have to say. Keep yourself educated on these topics and make sure your activism 
        is focused around marginalized groups. Also be sure to give BIPOC activist the 
        recognition they deserve, everyone should feel represented and celebrated! The <a class="link" href="https://www.ienearth.org/">
        Indigenous Environmental Network</a> an alliance of indigienous peoples and it acts as
        a great resource. This is one of many! See our <a class="link" href="education.html">Addition Education</a>
