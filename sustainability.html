     Personal Sustainability

    <p class="main-text">
      We need large-scale change to truly combat the climate crisis, but people should still be making every attempt to decrease their personal waste. If you have the means to make small changes in your lifestyle, you can begin to live more sustainably. 
      People are constantly producing waste which can easily be eliminated.

        What is sustainability?
      </h4>
      <p class="answer">
        In the context of the environmental movement, sustainability is 
        living in a way that can be maintained for a long time without creating 
        as much waste as you might normally. Living sustainable might seem like an overwhelming task. 
        However, just a few extra steps in your life can make a big difference.
